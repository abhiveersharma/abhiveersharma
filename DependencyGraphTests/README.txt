# Comments to Evaluators:

This is a MSTest Project where I test DependencyGraph.CS and test all the methods like AddDependency,
RemoveDependency, HasDependees, HasDependents, etc.
This is also contains tests provided by the instructor on the canvas instructions page for this assignment.
I am linking the page here - https://utah.instructure.com/courses/754704/assignments/10141500?module_item_id=16487982
I implemented a similar assignment last semester, as I am retaking the class.
Some of my work in DependencyGraph.CS might resemble my earlier implementation.
I am referencing that work and linking my repository -

No peers in this class were consulted during the implementation of this project but, I did take inspiration from Prof. Daniel Kopta's lecture from last semester
