# Comments to Evaluators:

The purpose of this assignment is to implement the "internals" of a spreadsheet program. 
Now, we can get the contents of cells, set the contents of cells (For example, cell "A4" contains value 5.0)
There are many added features and our spreadsheet is also capable of detecting a circular dependency
For example, cell A1 could contain the string "a1", double 2.5 and a formula "A2+A3". 
I implemented a similar assignment last semester, as I am retaking the class.
Some of my work in Spreadsheet.CS might resemble my earlier implementation.
I am referencing that work and linking my repository -
