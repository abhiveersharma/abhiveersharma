# Comments to Evaluators:

We believe our Spreadsheet GUI works as detailed by the assignment specifications with some additional features. Our work stands on its own.

# Consulted Peers:

We consulted each other as partners.


# Partnership:

So far, all work has been done during pair programming! We met over Zoom and worked together on this assignment throughout.

# Branches:

No branches at this time.

# Additional Features and Design decisions:
Additional features include the following: 
    1. Default help text in formula box
    2. Keyboard shortcuts for file menu options (see file menu)
    3. Enter key evaluates the typed formula
    4. Mouse over formula textbox for tooltip
    5. Custom Form for help menu

In general, we designed the program to work how we would want it to work as users. We tried to make things as simple and as easy to use as possible within the 
scope of our limited GUI-creating abilities. This is why we stuck to buttons and textboxes and simple-to-learn GUI elements that also were easy to use. Here is how
to use our program: 

File menu: The file menu in the top left corner allows you to...
    open a previously saved spreadsheet
    save your current spreadsheet
    open any number of new spreadsheets
    close the current spreadsheet (to avoid warnings, make sure to save first!)
Cell Operations:
    to select a cell, click on the desired cell or use the arrow or tab keys
    to edit a cell's contents, click on the Formula textbox and enter a new formula, then click the evaluate button or press Enter!

# Best Team Practices:

We were able to give each other ideas and help each other write code while pair programming. We also were able to switch off who was the typer
and who was the helper each day that we worked on the assignment. This helped us not get too burnt when programming and would help the other 
partner take the lead so that we could get a different perspective each day we worked. This helped us program better and not get stuck on certain 
implementation ideas or certain issues. Switching perspectives was quite helpful. We did not really assign tasks since we did pair programming the entire time.

To improve our teamwork, we can do better to be more efficient so that we can get done in time for future assignments. We want to be able to get better at
communicating so that we can get things done sooner. Other than that we worked well together. We were able to meet often and were able to both write good code.



# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Six:   Predicted Hours:       18         Actual Hours:  27  (pair programming the entire time)
