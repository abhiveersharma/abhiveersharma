# Comments to Evaluators:

The purpose of this assignment is to keep track of dependencies between cells in a spreadsheet. 
We use a Dependency Graph to represent this relation. For example, cell A1 could contain the formula A2+A3. 
But wait! A2 could contain the formula A3*A4. Thus, the problem your program has to solve is:
"Which cells have to be computed first?" or said another way
"What is the ordering of computation across all the cells?". 
I implemented a similar assignment last semester, as I am retaking the class.
Some of my work in DependencyGraph.CS might resemble my earlier implementation.
I am referencing that work and linking my repository -

# Consulted Peers:

No peers in this class were consulted during the implementation of this project but, I did take inspiration from Prof. Daniel Kopta's lecture from last semester
