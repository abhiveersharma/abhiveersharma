# Comments to Evaluators:

This is a MSTest Project where I test Formula.CS and test all the methods like Evaluate,
Equals, ==, etc. And also the constructor of this class
I implemented a similar assignment last semester, as I am retaking the class.
Some of my work in Formula.CS might resemble my earlier implementation.
I am referencing that work and linking my repository -

# Consulted Peers:

No peers in this class were consulted during the implementation of this project but, I did take inspiration from Prof. Daniel Kopta's lecture from last semester

# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Three:   Predicted Hours:          25     Actual Hours:       20
