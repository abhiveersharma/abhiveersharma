# Comments to Evaluators:

FormulaEvaluator's code has been made more general after the implementation of Formula and has added functionality
The work in this assignment, specifically the implementation of the extension class in Evaluator.CS is inspired by Prof. Daniel Kopta's work.
We detect most of the syntatctical errors in our formula in the constructor and then use the evaluate method from Assignment 1,
with some modifications(like handling doubles) and evaluate the formula.The implementation of Assignment Three might resemble earlier implementation of the same assignment last semester.
Also, the implementation of Equals, ==, !=, GetVariables, ToString methods in Formula has been inspired by Prof. Daniel Kopta's work.
I am referncing my earlier work and linking my repository -

# Consulted Peers:

No peers in this class were consulted during the implementation of this project but, I did take inspiration from Prof. Daniel Kopta's lecture from last semester

# Time Expenditures:

    1. Assignment Three:   Predicted Hours:          25       Actual Hours:       20
