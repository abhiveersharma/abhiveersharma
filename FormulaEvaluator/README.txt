# Comments to Evaluators:

Formula Evaluator project implements the Evaluator class that evaluates the value of integer arithmetic expressions written using standard infix notation and stricly follows the precedence rules and integer arithmetic 
For example, "2+5+7" should evaluate to 14.
I also implement an extension class - StackExtension, to help in the Evaluate method above in the Evaluator class. This class implements the IsOnTop method
The implementation of this class is inspired by Prof. Daniel Kopta's work.
I implemented the same algroithm last semester, as I am retaking the class. Some of my work in Evaluator.CS might resemble my earlier implementation. I am referencing that work and linking my repository -
