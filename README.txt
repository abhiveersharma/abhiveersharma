# Comments to Evaluators:

The purpose of this assignment is to implement the "internals" of a spreadsheet program. 
We have enhanced and extended functionality of our previous version by implementing methods like  SetContentsOfCell,
GetCellValue, Save & GetSavedVersion.
We can also detect errors like SpreadsheetReadWriteException if a file doesn't exist, etc.
I implemented a similar assignment last semester, as I am retaking the class.
Some of my work in Spreadsheet.CS might resemble my earlier implementation.
I am referencing that work and linking my repository -

# Consulted Peers:

No peers in this class were consulted during the implementation of this project but, I did take inspiration from Prof. Daniel Kopta's lecture from last semester
