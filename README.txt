# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating integer arithmetic expressions written using standard infix notation. It should respect the usual precedence rules and integer arithmetic.

The functionality of the spreadsheet has been updated after implementation of Assignment Two.
The purpose of this assignment is to keep track of dependencies between cells in a spreadsheet. 
We use a Dependency Graph to represent this relation.

The functionality of spreadsheet has been updated after implementation of Assignment Three.
In this assignment we will be focusing on how to take a more specific solution and make it more general.
Part of this process is turning a standalone static implementation into a more general reusable solution.
FormulaEvaluator's code has been made more general after the implementation of Formula and has added functionality.

The functionality of our Spreadsheet program has been updated after the implementation of Assignment Four
Now, we can get the contents of cells, set the contents of cells(For example, cell "A4" contains value 5.0)
There are many added features and our spreadsheet is also capable of detecting a circular dependency

The work in this assignment, specifically the implementation of the extension class in Evaluator.CS is inspired by Prof. Daniel Kopta's work.
The implementation of PS1 might resemble my earlier implementation, as I am retaking the class. 
I am linking my repository here: https://github.com/uofu-cs3500-fall21/spreadsheet-abhiveersharma/tree/main/Spreadsheet/FormulaEvaluator
which contains my previous work.
Some of my work in DependencyGraph.CS might resemble my earlier implementation.
I am referencing that work and linking my repository -
https://github.com/uofu-cs3500-fall21/spreadsheet-abhiveersharma/tree/main/Spreadsheet/DependencyGraph
The implementation of Assignment Three might resemble earlier implementation of the same assignment last semester.
Also, the implementation of Equals, ==, !=, GetVariables, ToString methods in Formula has been inspired by Prof. Daniel Kopta's work.
I am referncing my earlier work and linking my repository -
https://github.com/uofu-cs3500-fall21/spreadsheet-abhiveersharma/blob/main/Spreadsheet/Formula/Formula.cs

The implementation of Assignment four may resemble earlier implementation of a similar assignment as I am
retaking this class. I am referencing my last semester's work and linking my repository-
