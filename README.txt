# Overview of the Spreadsheet functionality

The Spreadsheet program is currently capable of evaluating integer arithmetic expressions written using standard infix notation. It should respect the usual precedence rules and integer arithmetic.
The functionality of the spreadsheet has been updated after implementation of Assignment Two.
The purpose of this assignment is to keep track of dependencies between cells in a spreadsheet. 
We use a Dependency Graph to represent this relation.
The work in this assignment, specifically the implementation of the extension class in Evaluator.CS is inspired by Prof. Daniel Kopta's work.
The implementation of PS1 might resemble my earlier implementation, as I am retaking the class. 
I am linking my repository here: https://github.com/uofu-cs3500-fall21/spreadsheet-abhiveersharma/tree/main/Spreadsheet/FormulaEvaluator
which contains my previous work.
Some of my work in DependencyGraph.CS might resemble my earlier implementation.
I am referencing that work and linking my repository -
